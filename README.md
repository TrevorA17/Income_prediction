# Income prediction
This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic factors and individual income using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The data includes variables such as age, sex, education level, occupation, marital status, and settlement size, which are analyzed to understand their influence on income levels. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling using multiple machine learning algorithms. A Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model was selected as the best-performing model based on cross-validation metrics. The final model is deployed via a Plumber API in R, allowing for real-time predictions based on user inputs. This project demonstrates the integration of data science and web APIs for practical, data-driven decision-making.
